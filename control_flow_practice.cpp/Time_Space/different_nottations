upper bound worse case

lower bound best case 

exact average case tight bound

TIME COMPLEXITY = WORSE CASE OF THE ALGORITHM BIG OH(UPPER BOUND)

O(1): Constant time complexity

O(log⁡ n): Logarithmic time complexity

O(n): Linear time complexity

O(nlog⁡n): Linearithmic time complexity

O(n2): Quadratic time complexity

O(2n): Exponential time complexity

even factorial complexity more worse
